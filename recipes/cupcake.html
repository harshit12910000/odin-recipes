        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> I put part of the cupcake batter in first so that the brownie part would be more centered, and ended up with exactly what I wanted. I had also refrigerated the brownie batter, but I don't know if that was necessary or not. I topped with the fluffy pb frosting and it was a great combination!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <h3>Brownie batter</h3>
            <li>1 (18 ounce) package brownie mix</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>½ cup canola oil</li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <h3>Cake batter</h3>
            <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package white cake mix</li>
            <li>1 ⅓ cups water</li>
            <li>3 large egg whites</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 48 muffin cups with paper liners</li>
                <li>Make brownie batter: Whisk together brownie mix, eggs, oil, and water in a large bowl until fully incorporated, about 50 strokes. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Make cake batter: Beat cake mix, water, egg whites, and oil in a separate bowl with an electric mixer on low speed until combined. Increase speed to medium and beat for 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Spoon brownie batter into the prepared muffin cups, about 1/3 full. Spoon cake batter over brownie batter until each muffin cup is about 2/3 full.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 20 minutes.</li>
